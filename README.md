First attempt at a Chess game. Using Pygame and Python. Currently there is a prototypically functioning board and pieces. The command line will tell you the legal moves for a selected pawn or bishop, other pieces have yet to be worked out. Upcoming features include:
Legal move list for all pieces
Pins added to legal moves
Enforced legal moves
Castling
En Passant
FullScreen or resizeable window
Better UI
Visual dots representing legal moves for selected piece
Move cancellation
"AI" to play against
