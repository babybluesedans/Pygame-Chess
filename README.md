First attempt at a chess game. Little messy but its working well. Functional board, enforced legal moves, checkmate/stalemate broadcasted from the terminal. Upcoming features include:
Code organization(lol)

FullScreen or resizeable window

Piece art options/board options

Board flipping

Better UI

A window caption! Because I have yet to be bothered
